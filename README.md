# Wrangling
Musings on Data munging


some thoughts on the process of getting data into a format that works best for getting the most information (graphical output, EDA, statistical measures)

```mermaid
stateDiagram
    [*] --> Fit_data_to_software
   

    Fit_data_to_software --> Fit_software_to_data
    Fit_software_to_data --> Fit_data_to_software
  
   Fit_software_to_data  --> [*]
```
when thinking about the tools that i use on the regular to bring data into a format that allows the easiest and most efficient method of getting the most amount of detail. timing is of the ssesnce. Excel is a great program. extended with visual basic is even better. <br>

GraphPad<br>
R<br>
Python<br>
Googlesheets macros.
